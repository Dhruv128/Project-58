        <div id="line"></div>
        <p id="about">My favorite hobby is to play chess in my free time. I like to play chess becuase it is a really fun game and most importantly it is really interesting.<br> I love playing online chess because it not only has normal chess but diffrent game modes. 1 of them is 4 player chess. Other than that there are puzzles and lessons to learn openings and improving you chess are there.<br> This is a quote said by a really great chess player called garry kasparov- Chess is a game of unlimited beauty. It is not all abut checks and attackes. You have to be creative. That is why i like chess.
